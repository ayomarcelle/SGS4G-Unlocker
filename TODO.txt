### TODO ###

### DONE ###
Add a debug output option. Should keep the output to just the unlock code and savefile location.
Add error checks when the script doesn't find a code.
Add error checks to each step and add verbose output indicating to the user what went wrong.
Add two cases for the dd command since the current format won't give any output even with debugging on.
